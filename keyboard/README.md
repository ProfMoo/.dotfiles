# Keyboard Configurations

I'm in the process of moving any keyboard configuration to Via.

These configurations can be loaded and saved to/from keyboards (the name of the keyboard is in the file name AND configuration).

The intent of these files is to provide the same development experience across all keyboards. This is especially important for hotkeys.
