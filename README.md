# Setup

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProfMoo/.dotfiles/master/run)"
```

## TODO

1. Provide a full one-liner for a blank system (maybe using curl to get a raw file and pipe into `sh`)?
2. Provide .vscode configuration
3. Auto-format files
4. Figure out .zsh_history so that it works as expected (ex: what happens when you use kubie?)
