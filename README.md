# Setup

1. Install `brew`
2. Install `git`
3.
```bash
cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/ProfMoo/.dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && ./install
```

## TODO

1. Provide a full one-liner for a blank system (maybe using curl to get a raw file and pipe into `sh`)?
2. Provide .vscode configuration
3. Auto-format files
4. Figure out .zsh_history so that it works as expected (ex: what happens when you use kubie?)
